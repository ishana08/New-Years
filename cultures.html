    <h2 class="title">1)Wearing White (Brazil)</h2>
    <h2>In Brazil, the new year is regarded as a time to reflect upon the past and make new resolutions for the coming year. Everyone wears white because the color signifies luck, prosperity, and is meant to ward off bad spirits. As the tradition goes, revelers gather on the beaches donning white garb where they jump seven waves—a lucky number in Brazilian culture—for good fortune and throw flowers into the water as an offering to Lemanjá, the goddess of the sea.</h2>

    <h2 class="title">2)Taking a bath in the river (Colombia)</h2>
    <h2>This tradition is only really celebrated in the Valle del Cauca region and the city of Cali - early in the morning on the 31st, people head to the Pance River just outside the city, and wash themselves with soap (if you can't make it to the river, you wash at home with sea salt). This apparently rids the body of bad energies for the year to come.</h2>

    <h2 class="title">3)Smashing Plates (Denmark)</h2>
    <h2>One of the most popular New Year's traditions in Denmark involves smashing plates and old dishes. Danish residents save their unused dinnerware and affectionately shatter them against doors of their families and friends as a way to ward off bad spirits. Other traditions include jumping off chairs at midnight to “leap” into the new year and consuming Kransekage, a wreath-shaped cake created using marzipan rings stacked on top of each other with a bottle of wine in the center. The cake is decorated with ornaments and flags.</h2>

    <h2 class="title">4)Burning Effigies (Ecuador)</h2>
    <h2>In Ecuador, burning effigies signifies burning the año viejo, or “old year.” Ecuadorians create large effigies in the likeness of politicians, pop culture figures, and other icons and set them on fire at midnight. It symbolizes the cleansing of bad energy from the previous twelve months, and is meant to bring about good fortune. The tradition originated in 1895, when a yellow fever epidemic hit Guayaquil and forced many to burn coffins packed with clothes of the infected. The tradition has since taken on a more lighthearted, optimistic nature and fills the streets of Ecuador in a celebratory manner today.</h2>

    <h2 class="title">5)Rosh Hashanah (Israel)</h2>
    <h2>Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, is celebrated in many countries around the world. The holiday takes place in the fall, during the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. During the night the holiday begins, a festival candle blessing is recited as well as the Kiddush, blessing over wine. Those celebrating enjoy apples and other fruits dipped in honey, which symbolizes sweetness and blessings in the coming year. Throughout the celebration of Rosh Hashanah, the shofar is sounded. This instrument is made of a ram's horn, and is meant to symbolize humility standing before God.</h2>

    <h2 class="title">6)Oshogatsu (Japan)</h2>
    <h2>Oshogatsu, the Japanese New Year, is one of the most important holidays in Japan. Like other New Year's celebrations, it symbolizes renewal, bidding farewell to problems of the previous year through a variety of customs and celebrations. In December, “year-forgetting parties” known as Bonekai take place. On December 31st, Buddhist temples strike their gongs 108 times; each ring representing one of the 108 earthly temptations a person must overcome to achieve nirvana and expel wrong deeds and ill luck of the past year.</h2>

    <h2 class="title">7)Consuming Grapes (Spain)</h2>
    <h2>The most prominent New Year's tradition in Spain involves consuming grapes. Each year, Spaniards partake in the annual tradition of eating one grape for every toll of the clock at midnight. The twelve grapes consumed are meant to represent good luck for each month of the year. Some even prepare their grapes by peeling and seeding beforehand to ensure they're easy to consume.</h2>

    <h2 class="title">8)Watching the Ball Drop (United States)</h2>
    <h2>New Year's traditions in America derive from a variety of origins and beliefs. After fireworks were banned in New York City in the early 20th century, event organizers arranged to have a 700-pound ball lowered down a pole. Since, it's become a tradition to watch the ball start dropping and count down the year's final seconds.</h2>

    <h2 class="title">9)First-Footing (Scotland)</h2>
    <h2>Scotland's Hogmanay celebration is one of the most rousing celebrations in the world. Hogmanay comprises street entertainment, fire festivals, concerts, street festivals, and more celebratory acts, but is also known for its tradition of “first-footing.” According to the custom, the first person who crosses the threshold of a person's home should bring a gift of luck. Traditionally, this gift was a coal for the fire or shortbread.</h2>

    <h2 class="title">10)Spring Festival (China)</h2>
    <h2>The Chinese New Year is rife with many different traditions. Homes and cities are lined with red decorations—a color that symbolizes good luck and good fortune—such as red lanterns to ward off bad luck and jianzhi, red paper cutouts that hang on walls. Fireworks are set off on both New Year's Eve and again the next morning as a means to ward off negative energy. Children also receive red envelopes that contain money, which is considered a way to symbolically transfer fortune from elder to youth. In addition, there are parades, lion dances, decorative dragon statues, traditional food, and imperial performances to cap off the celebration.</h2>
